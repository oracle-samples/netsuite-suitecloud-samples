# Summary
This script hides the Item column on the Item sublist for an invoice.

You are the NetSuite administrator for your organization. You use the invoice record type for your invoices. This record type includes everything you need to manage your invoices, but it also includes some fields you don’t need. In the Item sublist on an invoice record, you don’t need to populate the Item field. This field appears as a column in the Item sublist, and you want to use a script to hide this column before an invoice is edited. 
For more information about this customization project, see [Hide a Column in a Sublist](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_157305280561.html).

# Key Concepts
This sample demonstrates the following concepts:

* **SuiteScript 2.1** – This SuiteScript version is the latest available version and includes new language features that are not part of SuiteScript 2.0. This sample uses some SuiteScript 2.1 features, such as arrow functions. For more information, see [SuiteScript 2.1](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/chapter_156042690639.html#SuiteScript-2.1).
* **User event script type** - User event scripts are executed on the NetSuite server. They are executed when users perform certain actions on records, such as create, load, update, copy, delete, or submit. Most standard NetSuite records and custom record types support user event scripts. Exceptions include records used for personal identification purposes (such as a Driver’s License, Passport, or other Government-issued ID), some revenue recognition records, and some timecard-related records. For more information, see [SuiteScript 2.x User Event Script Type](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_4387799721.html#SuiteScript-2.x-User-Event-Script-Type).

# Loaded Modules

* **N/record** – To load and work with records. For more information, see [N/record Module](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_4267255811.html#N%2Frecord-Module).
* **N/log** – To log errors that occur during execution. For more information, see [N/log Module](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_4574548135.html#N%2Flog-Module).
* **N/ui/serverWidget** - To work with the user interface within NetSuite. For more information, see [N/ui/serverWidget Module](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_4321345532.html#N%2Fui%2FserverWidget-Module). 

# Script Type and Entry Points
This sample uses a user event script type with the following entry points:

* `beforeLoad` - Defines the function that is executed before a record is loaded; that is, whenever a read operation occurs on a record, and prior to returning the record or page.

# Helper Methods
This sample defines and uses the following helper methods:

* `hideColumnField(formObj, sublistId, fieldId)` - Hides the Item column.

# Customization Details
The customization for this use case includes:
* A user event script triggered on the beforeLoad entry point
